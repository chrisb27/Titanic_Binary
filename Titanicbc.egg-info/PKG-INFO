Description: # Titanic Binary Classifier
        
        Titanicbc is a simple interface for training binary classification Networks 
        or using a pre_trained network to output predictions for the Kaggle Titanic Dataset.
        
        Later versions will expand the package to contain more flexible interfaces and networks for other classic datasets.
        
        ### Installation
        
        You can install Titanicbc from PyPI
        
        ___
        pip install Titanicbc

        ## How to use
        
        ___
        
        Titanicbc provides a simple interface for training and using pre-trained networks via the config.yaml file.
        
        The options are presented below in the following format;
        
        option number. Key (value options) 
        
        1. data_load (csv, database) - csv loads csv files stored in Data folder as train and test, database loads files from
        train and test tables within a postgresql database
        
        2. num_columns (Integer) - number of columns in the train dataset
        
        3. train_new (True, False) - If true, a new neural network will be trained. If False the model parameters saved
        in trained_model.pth will be loaded and used for predictions.
        
        4. hidden_dim (Integer) - Number of neurons on each of the 3 hidden layers within the network
        
        5. output_dim (Integer) - Number of output neurons in the network, defaults to 1 for the classification network
        
        6. model_save_path (string) - Path to save and load models to, must be left as trained_model.pth is using the pretrained model in the package
